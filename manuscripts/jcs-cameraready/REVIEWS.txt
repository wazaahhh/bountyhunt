Comments:

p5 "a software many not" -> software many not
DONE

"has played a significant role" -> played a significant role
DONE - slightly different

p6 "resort to the larger crowd" -> recruit a larger crowd
DONE

p13 "bug bounties programs" -> bug bounty programs
DONE + fixed a double-the etc.

p15 "may have not be seen by other" -> may not have been seen by other
DONE

"for each researcher individual" -> for each individual researcher
DONE

"It can also be" -> They can also be
DONE

"accounts for technical difficulties and insufficient incentives
together" -> accounts for both technical difficulties and insufficient
incentives
DONE

p16 "bug, is" -> bug is
DONE

p16 the amount I will rationally pay to play the St Petersburg lottery
is the log to the base two of the maximum amount I believe the other
player will pay me. So against a poor maths lecturer with a net worth
of no more than $2^16, I should offer no more than $16.

But if you assume the reward never exceeds what the black hats will
pay (several hundred K) and the vendor's budget if smaller, such
philosophical arguments may be moot.
XXXXX STILL TO BE ADDRESSED XXXXX

p18 there may also be herding effects leading a mother event to have
more daughters. Another possibility is fatigue and boredom. Both can
be bundled in H1-3 (p21)
XXXXX STILL TO BE ADDRESSED XXXXX

p23 the negative result for H3 might suggest that boredom isn't
necessarily the main thing though.
XXXXX STILL TO BE ADDRESSED XXXXX

p25 "hire a hand security czars from a larger crowd" -> hire a band of
security czars from a larger crowd
DONE

"for hiring purpose" -> for hiring
DONE

"reduce engagement of researchers" -> reduce engagement by researchers
DONE

p26 perhaps if Uber hires 15 researchers, that's enough. In fact, how
many is enough? Even markets don't have infinitely many players, and
as you show, they flock to the newest projects
XXXXX STILL TO BE ADDRESSED XXXXX

"have already well performed" -> have already performed well
DONE

"may feature older programs to security researchers" -> perhaps you
mean "offer"?
DONE - used "highlight"

"received a major update" -> receives a major update
DONE

p27 if following rec B you throttle back rewards during congested
periods, you incentivise people to sell on the black market, contrary
to rec c
XXXXX STILL TO BE ADDRESSED XXXXX

"apply indistinctly" -> apply indiscriminately
DONE

"relative advantages bureaucracy" -> relative advantages of bureaucracy
DONE

p28 "less options regarding switching" -> fewer options to switch
DONE
