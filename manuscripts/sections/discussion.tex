\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
Finding bugs in software code is one of the oldest and toughest problems in software engineering \cite{adams1984textordfeminineoptimizing}. While algorithm based approaches have been developed over the years \cite{avgerinos2014enhancing}, human verification has remained a prime way for bug hunting. While resorting to the crowd for finding bugs is not new \footnote{The first known bug bounty is the reward check program implemented by Donald Knuth in 1985 for debugging his book {\it TeX: The Program} ({\it http://truetex.com/knuthchk.htm}).}, bug bounty programs have recently been promoted by the emergence of bug bounty platforms. Here, we have studied incentive mechanisms across 35 bug bounty programs on HackerOne, one of such platforms. Our results show that the number of discovered bugs and vulnerabilities in a bounty program is super-linearly associated with the number of security researchers. However, the distribution of bugs found per researcher per program is bounded: In a given bug bounty program, the marginal probability of finding additional bugs is decreasing rapidly. On the contrary, security researchers have high incentive to switch among multiple bug bounty programs. We find indeed that each newly launched program has a negative effect on submissions to incumbent bug bounty programs. Furthermore, controlling specifically for monetary incentives, we find that the reward amount for valid bugs in newly launched programs has a negative effect on the number of bug submissions to incumbent programs.  \\

We find quantitative evidence for the incentive mechanisms associated with bug discovery by crowds of security researchers, and help draw practical organization design recommendations for bug bounty platforms such as HackerOne, as well as for organizations managing bug bounty programs.\\
 
Our results provide an essential validation step to the theory formulated by Brady et al. \cite{brady1999murphy}. No single security researcher is able to find most bugs in one program. On the contrary, a good bug bounty program involves submissions from a diverse crowd of security researchers. Borrowing to the formulation by Brady et al. of software security as a phenomenon of evolutionary pressure dictated by environmental changes, we shall propose that any additional security researcher involved in a bug bounty program brings a unique combination of skills and mindset, which is at least partially different from all other researchers. This unique perspective is comparable to a slightly changing environment for the software piece under scrutiny, which brings unique opportunities for each security researcher, regardless of the opportunity level of other researchers focused on the same software piece. Yet because people cannot easily change their skills and mindset, once the opportunity has been exploited, finding additional bugs gets much harder, hence pushing toward other opportunities, such as newly launched bug bounty programs.\\

The intrinsic limited capability by each single security researcher to find a large number of bugs for a specific program (i.e., on a specific software piece) carries a strong justification for the existence of bug bounty programs as a tool for engaging a large and diverse crowd of security researchers, beyond internalized software testing and security research teams. While we do not make any recommendation on the seniority and trustworthiness level of the security crowd targeted and engaged in a specific program, we may however discuss the {\it Uber} bug bounty program launched in 2016 \cite{moussouris2016}. This organization has designed its program as a way to select and hire a hand ``security czars" from a larger crowd. Although there is certainly nothing wrong with hiring a security expert in an opportunistic manner, our results rather suggest that systematically using bug bounty programs for hiring purpose may reveal counter-productive on the long term. Security researchers will be likely to tune their expectations and behaviors toward getting a job. The approach implemented by Uber may reduce engagement of researchers who don't expect to get a job offer. Thus, it could limit the involvement of a larger crowd and its renewal, as more permanent security positions get filled. \\

The strategy followed by Uber for its bug bounty program is also interesting from a theoretical perspective: Uber is following a well-known strategy first described by Ronald Coase \cite{coase1937}, which prescribes that if an organization has repeated interactions on the market with the same counterpart -- or {\it ceteris paribus} a similar counterpart, then the organization is better-off internalizing the resource in order to avoid repeated transaction costs. Hence, Uber considers that security researchers as {\it substitute goods}, while our results, as well as the mere existence of bug bounty programs, rather demonstrate that security researchers are {\it complements}, at least partially. The distinction between substitutes and complements regarding security researchers, brings a fundamental justification for the existence and the future development of bug bounty programs as market places for trading bugs and vulnerabilities \cite{bohme2006comparison}. \\

Yet, the organization designs of bug bounties programs and online platforms supporting them are still pretty much empirical. The validation step performed here provide additional theoretical insights. On the one hand, these insights shall be useful to formulate recommendations. On the other hand, they help identify blind spots, which will deserve future theoretical and empirical research efforts.

\subsection{Recommendations}
We propose 3 major recommendations that may significantly improve the efficiency of bug bounty programs, the platforms hosting them, as well as maximize the engagement of security researchers. 

\subsubsection{Encourage renewal, mobility and enrollment}
Bug bounty programs shall encourage mobility by devoting resources to the recruitment of security researchers who were not previously involved in the program, rather than making effort to keep security researchers who have already well performed engaged. Mobility increases chances to find security researchers with genuine skills and mindset, who in turn will find additional bugs. Similarly, bug bounty platforms have the possibility to encourage mobility across bug bounty programs. We have found that mobility across programs already exists, in particular mobility from old to newly launched programs. We also advocate the active recruitment of new security researchers by both bug bounty programs and platforms. For example, the bug bounty platform may feature older programs to security researchers who have recently enrolled on the platform.

\subsubsection{Feature major changes for front-loading}
The launch of a new bug bounty program is a unique moment that attracts a large number of security researchers. Yet front-loading may also be organized when a software piece received a major update with higher probability of finding bugs. Bug bounty program managers are encouraged to feature significant changes in the codebase, to help security researchers focus on issues they have not been exposed previously. Organizing engagement in order to match demand with supply is a token of fairness for security researchers who may appreciated to be guided to windows of high opportunity. This approach may also help the bug bounty program manager to steer the attention of security researchers toward more pressing security issues. Front-loading can also be organized with a temporary bug bounty reward increase. Additionally, dynamic adaptation of incentives can help manage contingencies associated with the management of submissions, for instance by reducing reward during a temporary overload. 
 
\subsubsection{Organize fluid legitimate markets}
One overarching concern with trading bugs and vulnerabilities is the temptation by security researchers to consider selling their bugs on the black market. One way is to streamline transactions costs associated with bug submission and reward operations. Encouraging mobility without providing market fluidity indeed exposes to the risk that more bugs get submitted more often on the black market. Our proposition is reminiscent of the strategy followed by {\it Apple Inc}: By offering cheap enough online music, easy to download on {\it iTunes}, Apple Inc. was able to capture most of the online music black market, such on {\it Napster}. Bug bounty programs face similar challenges and opportunities to capture a market by reducing transaction costs and alleviating uncertainties associated with being involved on the black market.

\subsection{Importance}
Our recommendations stem directly from the validation step performed. They show the importance of having a clear view of the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of the mechanisms of bug bounty programs and of platforms organizing them. Mobility, front-loading and fluidity may be organized either through top-down bureaucracy, or by setting market incentives right. The relative advantages bureaucracy and market organizations shall be further studied. Our recommendations for designing bug bounty programs, apply indistinctly to public and private bug bounties. Private bug bounty programs however face additional effort to encourage renewal, mobility and enrollment and front-loading, while at the same time curating the security researchers invited to participate in the private program. 

%We also suggests that both individual bug bounty programs and bug bounty platforms shall aim at constantly attracting more researchers, in light of the results in Section~\ref{sec:enrollment}. Previous work~\cite{zhao2015empirical} has made several suggestions, such as a first time bonus, to achieve this goal. We further suggest that current private bounty programs should gradually increase their enrollment and eventually go public. Receiving no bugs in the private stage does not indicate that the system is secure. Rather, it is more likely that the system has not been fully tested by the crowd. In addition, bug bounty platforms should improve their researcher invitation/allocation mechanisms to encourage the flow of diverse researchers to different programs~\cite{zhao2016crowdsourced}.


\subsection{Limitations}
Our study would benefit from additional empirical research using data which is currently not available from public sources. First, our study is limited by the impossibility to estimate the resource costs that security researchers bear when searching for bugs (e.g., time spent). This information would help further test and understand our theory and results which show that it exists physical limitations regarding the possibility for an individual to find an arbitrarily large number of bugs. Information on the cost functions would also bring further insights on the actual expected utility functions by security researchers, in particular the distinction between expected monetary rewards and effort devoted to reputation seeking.\\

We may also further question how bug bounty program operations impact the motivation of researchers: For example, bug bounty programs may be temporarily overloaded with submissions \cite{zhao2014exploratory,zhao2015empirical} associated with priority queueing and contingent delays \cite{maillart2011quantification}. Delays and contingencies, Such as timing and discounting effects, contribute to increase transaction costs and uncertainties for security researchers. Deeper understanding of the dynamics associated with bug bounty program operations may help establish a benchmark on the performance of organization designs and their implementations.\\

Finally, there is evidence that security researchers specialize : researchers typically have specialized knowledge and skills. The competitive environment associated with bug bounty programs reinforces incentives to specialize. Two types of specialization exist in bug bounty: program-specific and bug-specific~\cite{zhao2014exploratory,zhao2015empirical}. \textit{Program-specific} specialization is associated with the knowledge, experience and skill of finding vulnerabilities in websites and software products in one particular program. Since specialization is relatively unique to the program, a specialized researcher has less options regarding switching between programs. \textit{Vulnerability-specific} specialization is associated with knowledge and skills of a particular type of vulnerability, which can exist in many different products. Researchers with vulnerability-specific specialization have stronger incentive to explore different bug bounty programs. Specialization must accounted for when implementing organization design recommendations. In some circumstances, it may be desirable to attract a crowd of diverse yet specialized security researchers. Depending on the specialization required, targeting specific security researchers may however restrict the diversity of the resource pool. Specialization is also associated with the concept of ``skills and mindset", which we have introduced here to explain the observed hard limits regarding the number of bugs a single researcher can find. This notion deserves a more thorough definition, theory and testing as an empirical fact. \\
